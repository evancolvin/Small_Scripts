# Small_Scripts
## This serves as a Collection of miscellaneous scripts that I've written that might be useful to someone else.

TopTweets.py was my first exploration into Twitter's API. It takes a user as input and returns the most favorited tweets they've put out. Useful because Twitter—as far as I know—doesn't let you sort tweets.

word_count.py will open up all the .docx files a user gives it and returns how many words were in each file. Useful if you need productivity stats for several hundred documents like I once did.

monty_hall.py is a simulation proof based on the Monty Hall problem. It returns the proportion of cars won if you set the 'switch' flag to True, and the proportion of cars won if you set the 'switch' flag to False. 

Other scripts will be added
