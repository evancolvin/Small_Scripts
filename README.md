# Small_Scripts
## This serves as a collectoin of miscellaneous scripts that I've written that might be useful to someone else.

TopTweets.py was my first exploration into Twitter's API. It takes a user as input and returns the most favorited tweets they've put out. Useful because Twitter—as far as I know—doesn't let you sort tweets.

word_count.py will open up all the .docx files a user gives it and returns how many words were in each file. Useful if you need productivity stats for several hundred documents like I once did.

monty_hall.py is a simulation "proof" for the Monty Hall problem. It will return the proportion of wins and loses depending on whether "switch" is set to True or False

There's a small vizualization function that can output the running proportions like this:

Other scripts will be added
